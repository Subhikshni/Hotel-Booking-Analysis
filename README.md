## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is included in the `data/` directory. It has been cleaned and preprocessed to ensure accurate and meaningful results.

## Analysis
The analysis is divided into several steps:
1. Data Cleaning: The data cleaning process involved handling missing values, removing duplicates, and ensuring consistency in the dataset.
2. Descriptive Statistics: Key descriptive statistics, such as mean, median, mode, and standard deviation, were calculated for relevant variables.
3. Segmentation Analysis: The data was segmented to identify patterns and trends within specific categories, such as location, room type, and booking channel.
4. Correlation Analysis: Correlations between different variables were explored to uncover relationships in the data.
5. Visualizations: Various types of visualizations, including bar charts, count plots, pie charts, and line graphs, were created to present the findings.

## Visualizations
The `visualizations/` directory contains all the generated visualizations in PNG or other relevant formats.
